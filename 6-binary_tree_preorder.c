/**
 * binary_tree_preorder - Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
 * @func: Pointer to a function to call for each node
 *
 * Description: This function traverses the binary tree using pre-order
 * traversal, meaning it first visits the root node, then recursively
 * traverses the left subtree, and finally recursively traverses the right
 * subtree. For each visited node, the function calls the given function
 * `func` with the value of the node as a parameter.
 *
 * If tree or func is NULL, do nothing.
